This is my personal homepage written in English (and in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)), a site mainly to record my study in Statistics and some other related topics.

Some years ago when I read the book *Statistics And Truth*, I found the statements in its preface quite interesting:

> All knowledge is, in final analysis, history.
>
> All sciences are, in the abstract, mathematics.
>
> All judgements are, in their rationale, statistics.

If you are curious about these sorts of judgments, you may be interested in some of my [blogs](/blogs/). I also post articles on programming techniques, especially for the [R](http://r-project.org/) language.

This site is driven by [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/). You can find the source code of this site in my [GitHub page](https://github.com/yixuan/). The theme is modified from a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) template called [Hum](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/hum/).

I also have a Chinese homepage. Please [come here](http://yixuan.cos.name/cn).
