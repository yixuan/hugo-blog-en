I am Yixuan Qiu, currently an associate professor in
[School of Statistics and Data Science](https://ssds.sufe.edu.cn/) at
[Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE)](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/).
Before joining SUFE in 2020, I was a postdoctoral researcher in
[Department of Statistics and Data Sciencec](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/),
working with Dr. [Kathryn Roeder](https://kathrynmroeder.github.io/) and
Dr. [Jing Lei](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/). I obtained my PhD degree in statistics
from [Purdue University](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/) in 2018, advised by
Dr. [Lingsong Zhang](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~lingsong/) and
Dr. [Xiao Wang](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wangxiao/).
Prior to my PhD study in Purdue, I graduated from [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn/)
for B.A. and M.A. in statistics and actuarial science, respectively.

My research focuses on statistical machine learning and inference. I have great interest
in statistical computing, deep learning, exact inference methods, large-scale data analysis, and data visualization.
You can find some of my works in the [Research](/research/) page.

I am also enthusiastic about programming and developing high-performance software packages
for statistics and machine learning. The [Software](/software/) page
lists some open source software packages that I have written and maintained over the years.
Feel free to stop by my [GitHub](https://github.com/yixuan/) page, and even better, give me a
star for projects that interest you.

I have been constantly (although slowly!) writing technical [blog posts](/blogs/) on statistics and programming.
Just leave a comment there if you have any thoughts on some topics.

You can always reach me through email, [yixuanq [at] gmail [dot] com](#).
